        AI-Droid is a club we recently established. In this club, you\'ll have the opportunity to learn how to create apps using Android Studio.\n\n
        We named our club AI-Droid because we\'ll also focus on developing <u><b>machine learning (ML)</b></u> and <u><b>deep learning (DL)</b></u> models, which we\'ll later integrate into our apps.\n\n
        Additionally, we\'ll teach you how to create better <u><b>UI/UX</b></u> designs, use <u><b>GitHub</b></u>, implement <u><b>NoSQL for cloud storage</b></u>, and explore other relevant technologies when possible.\n\n
        Join our club to create and share fun, professional apps with your friends!\n\n
        <b>Pre-requisites: Basics of Java</b>
